# Survey of Probability Concepts

> **This is a quick intro of probability, from scratch to almost stochastic process.**

## Outline

1. Experiments with random outcomes
	1. Ingredients of a probability model
	2. Random sampling
	3. Consequences of the rule of probability
	4. Continuity of probability
	5. Measurability
2. Conditional probability and independence (Forgot to add the independence part Will add them shortly in the future.)
	1. Conditional probability
3. Random Variables
	1. A first look
	2. Probability distributions of random variables
	3. Cumulative distribution function
	4. Expectation
4. Conditional Distributions and expectation
	1. Conditioning on an event
	2. Conditioning on a random variable
	3. Conditional distribution for jointly continuous random variables
	4. Conditional expectation
	5. Conditioning on multiple random variables
5. Time-Homogeneous Markov Chain
	1. Finite states, time-homogeneous chains
	2. Transition probability (Unfinished)
