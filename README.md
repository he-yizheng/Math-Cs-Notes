# Collections of Notes (MATH/CS/NEURO/etc.)

For storing and sharing the notes, definitely one of my most favorite places, just like my outdoor gear room. It feels nice to see all the collections together... 
## Ongoing Updating Notes
- **Differential Equations** (Perhaps handwritten)
- **MATH324: Statistics** (Winter 2025)
- **MATH547: Stochastic Processes** (Winter 2025)
- **NEUR503: Computational Neuroscience** (Winter 2025)
  (Would be more like notes for neuroscience knowledge and models.)

## Incoming Notes (Planning)
- **Vector Calculus** (Perhaps handwritten)

## Archived Notes
### Mathematics
- **MATH222: Multivariable Calculus (Summer 2024)**
  (It used a linear algebra heavy way to introduce multivariable calculus. One of my most favorite courses so far.)
- **MATH240: Discrete Structures (Fall 2024)**
  (Intro. to serious proof-based math for CS students at McGill.) 
- **MATH323: Probability (Fall 2024)**
  (I extended the notes, so it goes beyond the course content quite a bit. I like it better now, as a formal introduction to probability.)

### Computer Science
- **COMP250: Introduction to Computer Science** (Fall 2024)
  (Notes for midterms prep.)
